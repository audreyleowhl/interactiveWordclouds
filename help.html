            <h1>What is it all about?</h1>
            <p>
                3rd year project about Interactive Word Clouds. <br><br>

                The goal of this project is to create a web application which will allow users to create word clouds which consist of single words as well as compound words from multiple sources of text.
            </p>

            <h1>Ways of using the web application</h1>
            <p>
                You can either enter text in the text area, or select a file from your computer to generate the text for the word cloud.<br><br>

                If you have selected a file but wish to change your file selection, you can just select another file, and that should replace the file you previously selected.<br><br>

                By using the radio buttons to select between 'Text' and 'File', you can choose to generate word clouds from either text or file. Selecting <code>Text</code> means that you chose to generate word clouds from the text entered in the text area, while selecting <code>File</code> means that you chose to generate word clouds from the file selected.<br><br>

                You can also choose to generate word clouds consisting of either single words or compound words by clicking on the buttons <code>Single word cloud</code> and <code>Compound word cloud</code> respectively. If you are not happy with the created word cloud, clicking on the button again will regenerate the word cloud.<br><br>

                The <code>Clear text</code> button allows you to clear all the text in the text area, and clicking on <code>How to use</code> allows you to see what can be done in this web application and more information about it.
            </p>

            <h2>How to generate compound word clouds</h2>
            <p>
              To generate compound word clouds, you will need to select a text file in your local system which contains the following format:
            </p>
            <pre>
                8   ice cream
                1   compound word
            </pre>
            <p>
              where the numbers represent the frequency of the compound word. The spacing between the frequency and the compound word should be a tab key.<br><br>

              Once the text file has been selected, you can click on the <code>Compound word cloud</code> button to generate the compound word cloud from the text file.
            </p>

            <h1>Web browsers</h1>
            <p>
                This web application currently works with all web browsers.
            </p>

            <h1>File formats</h1>
            <p>
                This web application currently only works with these file formats:
                <ul>
                    <li>.txt</li>
                    <li>.pdf</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                More work is currently being done to allow for more file formats.
            </p>

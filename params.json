  "body": "# Interactive Word Clouds\r\n\r\n3rd year project about Interactive Word Clouds.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to create a web application which will allow users to create word clouds which consist of single words as well as compound words from multiple sources of text.\r\n\r\n**Working project can be found [here](http://audreyleowhl.github.io)**\r\n\r\n## Ways of using the web application\r\n\r\nYou can either enter text in the text area, or select a file from your computer to generate the text for the word cloud.\r\n\r\nIf you have selected a file but wish to change your file selection, you can just select another file, and that should replace the file you previously selected.\r\n\r\nBy using the radio buttons to select between 'Text' and 'File', you can choose to generate word clouds from either text or file. Selecting `Text` means that you chose to generate word clouds from the text entered in the text area, while selecting `File` means that you chose to generate word clouds from the file selected.\r\n\r\nYou can also choose to generate word clouds consisting of either single words or compound words by clicking on the buttons `Single word cloud` and `Compound word cloud` respectively. If you are not happy with the created word cloud, clicking on the button again will regenerate the word cloud.\r\n\r\nThe `Clear text` button allows you to clear all the text in the text area, and clicking on `How to use` opens up this page on a new tab or window, allowing you to see what can be done in this web application and more information about it.\r\n\r\n### How to generate compound word clouds\r\n\r\nTo generate compound word clouds, you will need to select a text file in your local system which contains the following format:\r\n\r\n````\r\n8   ice cream\r\n1   compound word\r\n````\r\n\r\nwhere the numbers represent the frequency of the compound word. The spacing between the frequency and the compound word should be a tab key.\r\n\r\nOnce the text file has been selected, you can click on the `Compound word cloud` button to generate the compound word cloud from the text file.\r\n\r\n## Web browsers\r\n\r\nThis web application currently works with all web browsers.\r\n\r\n## File formats\r\n\r\nThis web application currently only works with these file formats:\r\n- .txt\r\n- .pdf\r\n\r\nMore work is currently being done to allow for more file formats.\r\n\r\n## Software\r\n\r\nThis web application uses these external software:\r\n- [wordfreq](https://github.com/timdream/wordfreq) by timdream\r\n- [wordcloud2.js](https://github.com/timdream/wordcloud2.js) by timdream\r\n- [pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) by mozilla\r\n- [Termine web service](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/webservice_key/) by NaCTeM\r\n",

By using the radio buttons to select between 'Text' and 'File', you can generate word clouds from either text or file. You can also choose to generate word clouds consisting of either single words or compound words by clicking on the buttons `Single word cloud` and `Compound word cloud` respectively. The `Clear text` button allows you to clear all the text in the text area, and clicking on `How to use` opens up this page on a new tab or window, allowing you to see what can be done in this web application and more information about it.\r\n\r\nThe `Compound word cloud` button is currently disabled while I work on the functionality for it.\r\n\r\n## Web browsers\r\n\r\nThis web application currently works with all web browsers.\r\n\r\n## Software\r\n\r\nThis web application uses these external software:\r\n- [wordfreq](https://github.com/timdream/wordfreq) by timdream\r\n- [wordcloud2.js](https://github.com/timdream/wordcloud2.js) by timdream","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

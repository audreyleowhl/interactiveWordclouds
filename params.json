By using the radio buttons to select between 'Text' and 'File', you can generate word clouds from either text or file. You can also choose to generate word clouds consisting of either single words or compound words by clicking on the buttons `Single word cloud` and `Compound word cloud` respectively. \r\n\r\nThe `Compound word cloud` button is currently disabled while I work on the functionality for it.\r\n\r\n## Web browsers\r\nThis web application currently works with all web browsers.\r\n\r\n## Software\r\nThis web application uses these external software:\r\n- [wordfreq](https://github.com/timdream/wordfreq) by timdream\r\n- [wordcloud2.js](https://github.com/timdream/wordcloud2.js) by timdream\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

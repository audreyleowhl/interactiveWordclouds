# Interactive Wordclouds

3rd year project about Interactive Wordclouds.

The goal of this project is to create a web application which will allow users to create wordclouds which consist of single words as well as compound words. 

## Simple run of the web application
Run 'index.html' in a web browser and then enter text in the textarea. Generate single-word wordclouds or compound-word wordclouds depending on the button you click.

## Web browsers
This web application currently only works with Firefox. Further work is being done to make it compatible with all other web browsers.

## Software
This web application uses these external software:
- [wordfreq](https://github.com/timdream/wordfreq) by timdream
- [wordcloud2.js](https://github.com/timdream/wordcloud2.js) by timdream
